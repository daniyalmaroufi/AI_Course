    "## Action\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent can do an action to reach another state. In this case, Gandolf can have six actions: going up, right, down, and left and picking a friend, and placing them in another position.\n",

    "## Transition Model\n",
    "\n",
    "UP action: If it is permitted, the agent will move from state (x,y) to state (x-1,y)\n",
    "\n",
    "DOWN action: If it is permitted, the agent will move from state (x,y) to state (x+1,y)\n",
    "\n",
    "RIGHT action: If it is permitted, the agent will move from state (x,y) to state (x,y+1)\n",
    "\n",
    "LEFT action: If it is permitted, the agent will move from state (x,y) to state (a,y-1)\n",
