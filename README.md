## CA0

This assignment aims to visualize a dataset of a bank and, using a simple classification model, predict if the customer opens a long-term account or not.

## CA1

This assignment aims to solve a problem using Uninformed and Informed search algorithms such as BTS, IDS, and A* algorithm. Finally, we compare the time complexity of these algorithms.

## CA2 - Game

This assignment aims to use adversarial game algorithms such as minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms to play the Connect4 game against a computer. 

## CA2 - Genetic Algorithm

This assignment aims to use the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find a decoded text's encryption key (14 characters). We prepared a global text to generate the dictionary, and we will use it to decipher the text.

## CA3 - Naive Bayes Network

This assignment aims to use Naive Bayes networks to build a classifier model to predict the category of an article from Digikala using its excerpt.

## CA4 - Machine Learning

This assignment aims to use the Scikit-Learn python library to build three classifiers, K-Nearest-Neighbors, Decision-Tree, and Random Forests, and optimize the hyperparameters.

## CA5 - Neural Networks

### Phase 1

This assignment aims to implement a neural networks API from scratch and use it to train a model for classifying handwritten Persian numbers.

### Phase 2

This assignment aims to use the Tensorflow library with the Keras API to recognize handwritten alphabets of this Kaggle dataset.
