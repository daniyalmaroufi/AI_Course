## CA0

This assignment aims to visualize a dataset of a bank and, using a simple classification model, predict if the customer opens a long-term account or not.

## CA1

This assignment aims to solve a problem using Uninformed and Informed search algorithms such as BTS, IDS, and A* algorithm. Finally, we compare the time complexity of these algorithms.

## CA2 - Game

This assignment aims to use adversarial game algorithms such as minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms to play the Connect4 game against a computer. 

## CA2 - Genetic Algorithm

This assignment aims to use the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find an encoded text's key string (14 characters). We prepared a global text to generate the dictionary, and we will use it to decode the text.
