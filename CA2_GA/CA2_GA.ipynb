Then, we guess a random encryption key and decrypt the text. If all the words are present in the extracted dictionary, we claim that the supposed key is correct and the target text is decoded successfully."

    "First, we generate 300 possible answers (chromosomes) as the initial population or the first generation. Then, we use a fitness function to rank the chromosomes. The fitness function presents how good each chromosome (solution) is. By comparing all chromosomes, we can find the best chromosomes of the generations. Then we will create a new generation based on these selected chromosomes using crossover and mutation processes. By repeating this process, we will finally find the solution that satisfies the expectations of the solution.\n",
